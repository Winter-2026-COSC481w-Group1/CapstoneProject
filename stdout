feat: Dockerize backend and integrate with cloud Supabase

This commit refactors the application to run as a Dockerized service and connects it to a cloud-hosted Supabase instance, removing the local Supabase stack.

Key changes include:
- Dockerized backend and Ollama services with environment-based configuration.
- Implemented JWT authentication using the cloud Supabase's auth service.
- Refactored the document upload process to use background tasks for improved performance and reliability.
- Added a new asynchronous task queue for PDF processing, including chunking and embedding.
- Centralized configuration in a `.env` file for easier management of secrets and settings.
